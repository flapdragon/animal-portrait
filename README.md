# animal-portrait
A simple app that makes a portrait from an original image of an animal, taking the image and a text prompt and returns a new image with the requested changes. Uses Hugging Face's image-to-image inference from HuggingFace.js, Node.js, Express, React and Bootstrap. Several animal and portrait type inputs are available on the front-end.
